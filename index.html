        During my internship as a Web Developer at Fullstack Academy in Manhattan (April 2023 - July 2023), I played a crucial role in leading the development of significant projects, showcasing expertise in JavaScript frameworks, HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. In a prior engineering internship at Wilson Tech Center (May 2022 - June 2022), I led the development of fully functional robots and designed a functional AM and FM radio system, demonstrating a diverse skill set for technical projects.
